# Numberpad

This is a 10 key hackpad that I just wanted to try and make based on a standard numberpad. This is my first experience working with making custom pcbs and a deeper use of CAD in general.

## CAD

This is a pretty basic case made using Onshape, basically able to surround all of the keys and have a visual of the XIAO RP2040 itself.

## PCB

This was my first time really delving into the usage of custom PCBs and KiCad as well. There is no matrix since all the keys are wired directly to their own pins.
